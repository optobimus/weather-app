## Short description

A weather forecast site using the API from OpenWeatherMap.

## Showcase

The user can use the input field to search for a city / location. The website will use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the information about the location, and the website will present it in different ways. The user can toggle the temperature units and switch between hourly and daily forecasts.
